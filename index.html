                    My interest for Tech didn't actually originate from software, about 3 years ago I got introduced to hardware or more specifically iphone hardware. I loved figuring out what very part did and how it worked. Later that same years I also looked into the world of custom PC's and what components are needed for a computer to run. Then, Myrthe or for most of you known as FoodieFarmer introduced me to programming, I love the idea of creating your own pieces of software to make your life easier. also as Josh said in boba talk #4, it gives the same feeling as building with Lego's. There was just one problem... although I loved the idea of programming, actually learning it was the biggest challenge. I tried 3 different courses, but every time I lost motivation be for I could learn the basics which let to me giving up. I stopped trying to learn any programming language for about half a year, until Foodie found Codédex and brought it to my attention. I love the way Codédex teaches, instantly applying everything you learn in to small and achievable projects is just the way to keep me motivated. Codédex worked for me and now I have a beginner understanding of not only Python but also HTML.

                        I wanna thank the Codédex team for creating this awesome course. and lastly the Codédex community for always being supportive when ever I didn't understand something.

                    I just really wanna say thank you to Foodie for introducing me to programming, but also for keeping me motivated throughout all 3 courses. I know that you have a lot more time to code than I do and I see this as a challenge to keep up, this is one of the biggest motivators that kept me focused on achieving my goals. Not only that, it is also just great to have someone to talk to about programming without being judged.
